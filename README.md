# MagicLeak
 The leak of MagicGames Plugins

# Context
 So the owners of MagicGames are just douchebags, They have not paid me for my work and they just delay it all the time. They even ghosted me when I asked for payments this is the reason I have decided to make everything public.

 They asked for a 2 week time period and i granted that but now after like 7 days I am being ghosted whenever I am asking for it. 

 MagicGames is just poopy clone of hypixel. Have fun Pushkar.

 Please Note: Most of these plugins are Mostly a fork of public plugins which are edited a lot to fit the desires of the server, 95% of the code has been done by my friend whom i consider as my brother so I am not leaking that part for now. I am only leaking parts of code which was not majorly done by him because me and him go way back. In case they are not gonna pay me the whole amount within the next 6 days, everything is gonna be available for public.
